# NIDS-Using-HybridApproach
Network Intrusion Detection System Using Hybrid Approach
The objective of this project is to develop a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using a hybrid detection approach that combines:

1. Signature-Based Detection: To identify known attack patterns.

2. Anomaly-Based Detection: To detect novel or unknown threats using machine learning techniques.

This system aims to:

Provide real-time monitoring of network traffic.

Achieve high accuracy in intrusion detection with minimal false positives.

Offer scalability and adaptability for various network environments.

The ultimate goal is to enhance network security by efficiently identifying and mitigating potential threats.
